I have found that there can be a big disconnect between what the leader believes and states and what the party believes and states it will do.  This is espeically true for the Conservative party.  There are so many factions in the conservative movement in Canada.  I am deeply afraid of the far right conservative part of the conservative party.  How Erin O'tool deals with that faction will be a consderation of my vote.

1003132,97,,,,I have no knowledge of him as a person so can only comment on his public persona.   He comes across as Andrew Scheer with slightly more charisma crossed with a not quite as angry John Baird.  His utter lack of leadership at dealing with Derek Sloan makes me hope that he never attains a position higher than Leader of the Opposition.

1003252,,,,,
1003253,34,,,,He's too extreme and unfit to lead our Country towards better days.
1003254,15,,,,I used to live in Bowmanville Ont and I never heard of him or his family until the Conservative Party leadership convention.
1003256,,,,,
2100011,34,33,,,"I've already described him.  He's a typical politician no matter his background and will do little if anything to better the lives of Canadians.

2100203,18,,,,"Erin O'Toole  supports the rich only. He never experienced financial hardship during the pandemic, therefore cannot relate to the general public who work in retail or in seasonal jobs to get by, lost jobs. If he doesn't care for the welfare of the general public why vote him? The public outnumbers corporations in terms of votes."
2100223,,,,,
2100236,97,,,,"Seems like they come from a good background and have expertise in various concepts that could potentially increase the economy, taxes, health and well being of the country. Reading more about Erin has allowed me to develop a better perspective on him"

2100276,97,,,,"Canada is large by area but small on population, which is aging, not being replenished fast enough, it is not a country like the United Sates where the individual  State governments tend to run things. Canadians depend on a federal government that will help when times are hard and give assistance when it's needed, not a one that will slash and take away from those who are most vulnerable. It may not be an environment for huge multinational profits but this is the kind of country Canada has always been and good trying to turn it into the US."
2100280,18,,,,"will not act in the best of interests of most Canadians, just the rich"
