120,2511,11,5.0,8.0,,I can't think of any good reason to support Joe Biden. He is a career politician and in 47 years has done nothing to improve life here in the USA.

130,2547,12,,,,Joe Biden is an honest and upstanding  individual. He is not bitter and hateful like the current president.

132,2553,9,6.0,8.0,2.0,He has is a compassionate and empathic person who can relate to everyone. No matter their political beliefs. He has a plan for healthcare and getting a grip on the Corona Virus. I feel he will be able to reach across the aisle and work with the Republicans.

163,2721,97,,,,BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE COVID CRISIS AND GET THINGS MOVING AGAIN
164,2726,97,,,,The left won?t riot and loot and whine if Biden is elected
165,2728,2,11.0,,,I don't see any reason to support Biden for President. He lies to our faces. He says one thing and does an about face and does exactly what he said he would not do. Biden and his family have become wealthy on the back of working people. He sent our jobs to China. Now we have to work to get them back in the U.S. Biden has not done anything for the American people for 47 years. I would not reelect him if he was the only person running for the office. Joe bailed out the car manufacturers when the economy tanked the last time and did not give anything to the working class people except loss of our AAA credit rating from the world bank the loss of our jobs. Our national debit was only claiming through the roof but for Joe it was business as usual.

He stood with Robert Byrd who was a Grand Klugel in the KKK and he voted against prison reform.  He is a weak leader with no plan, he will be run by the radical left of the democratic party.  He doesn't support police.  He and his son are totally corrupt in their dealings with Ukraine and China.  He stands for nothing and basically he is senile.  He can't talk without a teleprompter.  He can't lead the world as an American president should.  All those arguments you listed on the previous page Trump has already done and more.  Trump can make deals and get things done.  Biden is just a corrupt senile politician."
171,2754,12,,,,"he will keep ss and not destroy,it"
172,2755,1,,,,The best reason to support Biden is to get back to normalcy. Reestablish our relationships with our allies.
173,2758,5,,,,He is a decent American with leadership qualities that make him the best candidate to lead our country and make decisions for all Americans.

192,2811,6,,,,restat the working class
193,2816,12,7.0,3.0,,He isn't trying to take my livelihood away (social security disability). He will unite the country. He will get medical and prescription drug costs to a much better level. He will increase SS pay. He will improve the environment.

In my opinion, Joe Biden will bring nothing that will improve the country and he will make it worse if he becomes President! I say this even though I am not a big a big fan of Trump but compared to Biden he is much better for the US."

1399,8298,5,2.0,,,"I would never support Biden. From the beginning of his political career, he's never been honest."
1400,8303,99,,,,Joe Biden has the personality to get along with all peoples and has the ability to lead.
1401,8304,1,,,,That he's not Trump!  Trump has really messed things up royally over the past 3.5 years.  God help us if he gets another 4 years.  Four years from now will be a new election for anyone who doesn't like how Biden/Harris will lead the country.
1402,8312,97,,,,I have the impression that he tells the truth.  I am counting on that.

I wish everyone black man in america would call her out on that subject alone.  What's wrong with black men the reason SHE didn't marry one.?????   I would NEVER vote for Biden just because he picked Kamala Harris to gain the Black vote not because she is qualified and he sure isn't.  There isn't a Blk person anywhere near his neighborhood in DE yet he's seen on TV kissing every black person he can find.......
