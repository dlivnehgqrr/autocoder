2118,"Simply put, Donald Trump is mentally ill and extremely corrupt.",I can't believe that his deplorable supporters are excusing him for this. Shame on them. They always defend him by saying that he donated his salary back. Big deal. The expense of flying Air Force One literally DOZENS of times to Mar-A-Largo has cost taxpayers literally MILLIONS of dollars. The man is a clown.,,
2133,there is none.,"lies,lies",,
2134,It is time for a change for the better.,"Wow, but his total assets that he actually owns minus all the liabilities, makes him around middle class.",,
2140,He doesn't spout off like Trump,Charge him then,,
2141,Because he fair and honest and can be trusted for not lying to the public like Trump does all the time you do not know if he ever tells the truth or is living in space,He has been a crook all his life and only looks after his self and I still can not believe that people voted for him,,Transfer Agent
2144,He is better qualified for the job - and bring back respect for America,It proves how dishonest of a man he is - and how good of an American citizen he is. Trump doesn't care about the American citizens.,,
2145,He is not D. Trump,"His on Welfare ,Just like their welfare mom. But on an larger skill",Disable,
2149,"i do not support Joe Biden he is not good for president. I will vote for Donald Trump, he is the best candidate.",Donald Trump should pay all of his taxes just like everyone else,,
2165,Someone needs a new dogcatcher,Hes got a good accountant,,
2166,A better man than TRUMP,"ThT is terrible when Joe Biden paid $299,000",,
2167,"Although I have some issues with him, Biden has many years of experience in government, and can act in a sane and reasonable manner in governing the country and trying to rebuild our international relationships.","I find this information not at all surprising, but infuriating. He is just another example of how the wealthy are constantly cheating the system and getting away with it.",,
2170,"He isn?t a racist, sexist narcissist",Unsurprised.,,
2179,He is honest and wants to bring Americans together not tear the country apart.,Trump is a fraud and a con man.,,
2181,na,na,,retail
2185,I can?t think of any reason to support him,There was nothing illegal so I think it?s irrelevant,Self employed,
2189,None!,My reaction is I'd like to see proof before I believe anything from mass media,,
2190,really unsure,sickening,disabled,
2192,Honesty guy,Gets me mad,,
2194,He's honest & humble because he has experienced some of the same losses as the rest of us.,I was angry that he thinks he doesn't have to pay taxes.  He should be prosecuted for tax evation,,
2196,He is the better man to lead the country,Is it true?,,
2200,He's strong and cares about people like me.,He should be charged with tax evasion when he leaves office.,,
2204,To get Donald Trump out of office,Not surprised,,
2205,He is going to unite the country.,I think that this is wrong.,,
2208,He will not divide the country into two segments.  He also is not looking to have only white people here.,"He might be working the system to his advantage but he needs to lead by example.  He also,lied about being the highly successful businessman.",,
2210,I would not support Biden for President,I don't know how he could have paid such a small amount since his net worth is in the millions,,
2211,I believe he will be fair to the working class of people and not give in to the wealthy.,What? I know all my taxes were accounted for. Wish I could use his accountant.,,
2213,Nothing,Not sure,,
2217,There is not a reason.  He has done nothing in all his years in politics,"What a bunch of crap.  It would be great if the news could be reported to truthfully.  Even if it was true, if was done legally, what is the problem.  I sure wish Congress members would have their finances scrutinized as much as the president",,
2224,"He will unite, not divide our country",Disgusting,,
2225,"He condemned white supremacists. If you can't do the bare minimum and do that, then why would I even consider voting for you.","What. The. Hell. I paid more in taxes as a minimum wage, part-time worker. Even funnier is the fact that most of his support are much less wealthy than him and paid multiple times the amount he did.",,
2227,He is more honest and has more of the deamenor of a president.,I guess I would want to see it myself because unfortunately most of the media lies or twists the truth.,,
2228,None,It was a lie.,Disabled,
2229,None he has dementia,Awesome,,
2230,none,ridiculously,,
2231,I can find no reason.  He would not actually be an active president...Kamala & the very left will control what he does & says.,"Think it's false, however if true he is allowed to take the legal deductions allowed",,
2234,I?d rather not say exactly why.  But based on my research I believe he is the better candidate.,Unreal.  What a crook.,,
2236,Because I believe he would be a great president,Angry he should go to jail,,
2242,better for the country,he is a crook,,
2244,He is not Trump.,He is a crook and should be impeached,,
2249,he's not Trump.,not surprising,,
2252,He cares about us.,It is crazy.,,
2256,Healthcare,Not surprised,,Small Business owner
2258,He is competent and unify the country.,Either he an incredible bad businessman or he cheats on his taxes.,,
2261,hes a nice person,this seems ok,,
2265,His honesty,That is terrible. Ordinary working people pay thousands into taxes and only earn 50 or 60 thousand a year.  He has to be taking questionable deductions.  Poor people can't get away with doing that.  He should be audited.  .,,
2267,Concerns,Not good,,Retail
2270,none.he a black assed  you know what lover!!!,i couldnt care less.just wanna know how he did it!!!,,
2271,I really don?t know,I don?t know the whole story or the circumstances of why it?s only that much.  I know he has interest and determination to make America great and that is what?s important.  What happened in the past is in the past.  Let?s focus on the future!!!!!!,,
2281,Nothing to support him for.,Says who?? Trump haters,,
2284,"I don?t care for either one, but I dislike Trump much more.","It makes me sad that the rich always find a way to get around paying their fair share. If they could walk in our shoes for awhile, I bet things would be different.",,
2294,There isn't one.  He has been in this field for awhile and has done nothing so why would he start now? He talks stupid and doesn't remember things alot this is not someone that I would want to run my country.,It doesn't affect me at all so I really don't care.,,
2296,because its very good and i love it very much,its very good and nice and had know,,
2301,We need someone who can bring us together not break us apart,Unfairness,,
2302,I see no good reason to support Joe Biden for president.  He is a frightening far left liberal who is trying to destroy America,This is propaganda.  I have read that he paid millions of dollars in taxes,,
2306,He's a great guy maybe a little older but he knows what he's doing he'll briback America,it doesn't surprise me he gets away with so much stuff as a President it sickens me,,
2308,He will stabilize America after the dumpster fire of the last 4 yrs,Zero Surprise. The rich can game the system to pay as little as possible.,,
2310,Health care,Annoyed,,
2316,"he cares about the middle class, and I am middle class.  Donald Trump looks out for the upper class only.",it makes me mad that the rich pay a smaller percentage in taxes than the middle class and poor people!  It made me pretty mad that the system is so flawed.,,
2321,Trump and his cronies think they're the only ones fit to run everything. That commie one party to rule all will never happen in this country.,Not any real surprise. I've known Trump is a tax cheat and crook for many years.,,
2322,Health care,Because he probably gave enough money away to charities.  Trump has top notch financial advisors.  They would be able to instruct the best way to not have to pay taxes on already taxed money.,,
2325,He's a moderate who's not a socialist.,I think its proof our tax codes (state and federal) need some major overhauling (by a president who's not Trump) so some of these loopholes are closed and so billionaires like Trump pay more taxes.,,
2334,There is no reason,I don?t see how it?s anyone?s business,,Balloon Decoration
2335,there is no good reason to support Biden,I believe it was a headline that didn't prove out if you read the article. Also he didn't break the law. All these holier than thou people who are complaining aren't about to pay anymore tax themselves then they have to.,,
2338,Donald Trump is the Antichrist!,"I've worked for 18 years as a retail manager making just barely 34,000 a year, and I pay three times that in taxes every year. I shower every morning in a bathroom where parts of my ceiling is falling down, but I don't make enough money to even think about getting it fixed. And this creature has lived in luxury for his whole life, never once having to worry about money, and plotting this huge, elaborate scam to avoid paying his taxes? I'd have to say I'm a little resentful about that.",,
2341,It will stop Antifa from rioting.,"I don't really care.  If he did, it tells me that he knows how to play the economic game well. Kudos to him.",,
2351,He?s not Donald Trump.,It makes me like him even less.  Plus he?s lying about it.,,
2352,He has leadership skills. Trump does not.,I was not surprised. I think that Trump is dishonest and corrupt.,,
2353,He's not TRUMP.,He should be ashamed.,,
2355,He is ethical,It?s obscene.,,
2359,TO RID THE COUNTRY OF THUMPS BULLING....WE ARE SICK OF THE CONSTANT ANGER AND LYING,HE IS DISS HONEST AND MONEY HUNGRY,,
2360,He's not Trump,It's shit show & America is losing,,
2362,None,It doesn't bother me because be didn't do anything illegal and he just took advantage of tax laws in existence.,,
2369,Positive movement,Outraged,,
2372,Saving Social security,I need proof to believe anything about anyone in politics.,,
2374,"He has more experience, and is a much more decent person. He is honest, and wants equality.","I think he is the worst president, and the a very dishonest individual.",,
2378,he's slightly better than trump (if he is not going to drop dead when he's running or as president,that was nuts. how come did that happen?,,
2382,"Because I believe that he cares about this country, he has empathy and integrity.He care about the middle class.",I was very upset when I heard this because the state that I live in the taxes are very high. I have paid taxes every year and it is more than 750 dollars.,,
2383,They both suck at doing there thing,He suck,,
2384,He is honest and has great integrity. He is not afraid to work to make AMerica a better place for the low and middle income people who basically make up this country,Trump sure knows how to scam and cheat people and the government out of a lot of things including money he should be made to pay back for his illegal actions.,,
2385,There isn't one.,Did he or his accountants commit a crime? What's the point?,,Commercial printing sales
2387,Nothing,So what,,
2389,He will bring competency and decency back to the presidency.,Disgusting and shameful. Goes way beyond the typical rich guy tax dodging.,,
2391,I honestly can?t think of any,"It?s low, but with his businesses I am confident he pays plenty of other taxes",,
2392,There is NO reason to support Biden for president,I don't trust the information or the source.,,
2404,We have to dump Trump,Fuming!!!,,
2408,He will unite the United States,Doesn?t surprise me considering what a liar and snake he is,,
2417,I can't think of any reason to support Joe Biden for president,"Since he was President and donated his Presidential salary to government agencies and charity ($800k) while de-investing from the Trump businesses, I'm surprised he paid that much.",,
2418,"I can't think of any good reason to elect Biden.  He will have a very brief honeymoon, then the protests and civil disorder will continue at the same rate.    Electing him will convince the far left that America is behind their agenda.","This is misleading.  He paid substantial taxes in the years before that.  By overpaying in past years, he didn't owe for those years.  It also shows he sacrificed great personal wealth to become president.  IF you don't count social security (which is paid back and is not really a tax) most Americans pay no income tax.",,
2422,The bizarre comedy that a Biden press conference would be,Fuck yay! Can he do my taxes He rocks Screw the IRS,,
2423,Health,Shocked and angry,,
2424,Better than trump,Not surprised,,
2428,"The United States needs to be restored in the eyes of the world and in the health of its citizens and economy.  We need to work towards healing the divisions between races and classes in our country, divisions that have been made worse by the Trump years.  Joe Biden is an experienced statesman, he is a champion of democracy and human rights.  Joe Biden can heal our country, lift us up, and move us forward even surpassing where we were before Trump began to tear down the foundations of our society and government.","I am disgusted and not surprised that he has tried to exploit our country by withholding paying taxes like the rest of us.  He is a cheat, and a crook who surrounds himself with similarly corrupt people.  His greed and consequently his enormous debt make him a national security threat.",,
2430,He isnt trump,Its aggravating,,
2433,There are no good reasons for voting for Biden.,I don't believe anything I hear in the media about President Trump.,,
2437,He's honest,I think it's disgusting and he is worthless,,
2440,"there is no reason to vote for hi, he is not capable of leading this country",I do not believe this at all this is just a media playing games,,
2446,Not happy with the way Trump is handling things,Terrible. He should not be exempt from. Paying taxes,,
2447,I am having a rough time thinking of why I want to support him.,"Everyone makes and loses money all the time.  Some times the loses affect the earnings where it changes your tax level.  It happens even to the little people like me.  It is how the system was set up for everyone.  If you are a richer person with a lot of investments, it just shows up more.We could probably look at all the people in Washington and would be shocked at their tax es.",,
2448,because biden sounds like he would be a good president. Trump down play the coronavirus and he still does.  He divides our people. He allows the police to kill blacks .He is not a good president. He think only about his self then to help our people.,It's not fair. he did not do enough to help his country.,,
2449,There is no good reason to support him.,I think the government wastes billions of dollars each year and I think I can do a better job with my money than the government.,,Financial Services
2451,He is not insane,I pay that much!!!,,
2452,"He puts protecting healthcare, especially the retired, disabled, and unemployed first; restructuring the police system around the country; and getting control on the COVID-19 pandemic.",It's dishonest.,,
2454,I can't think of any he just like all others. Once he gets into office he'll forget all his promises,It seems top me he was giving all his salary to non profit groups so it could be a write off just as with anyone else who donates money. re How many others didn't pay their fare share,,
2457,"Because Trump is an Idiot, I happen to know this because I have met him.",I already told you Trumps A Chump...,,
2463,I do not have a reason to support him because of what he stand for,I wonder if it is true and if it is true what are the circumstances behind it,,
2470,"He CAN UNITE our country and tell us the truth-unlike what trump does every day to the American ppl, he ALWAYS lies to us and Joe I know wont do that","Does NOT surprise me and its also appalling cause he is such a cheat and thinks that this is how to run a country, its just beyond me how he is still the president-sickening really!!!",,
2472,hes got experience he cares hes more calming what we need right now,hes a con man hes always been hes a cheat a con man liar,,
2474,He will be better to unite the country so we can take on racial issues and coronavirus.,Not surprised. Tax lawyers/attorneys know the loopholes and what can be legally ?written off? so corporations and business owners pay very little taxes.,,
2476,He lies a lot less and doesn't support the good old boys!,"He is a ridiculous, selfish man who only loves himself. A liar and think he is always right!",,
2478,He can do. It,No good president,,
2481,I can't think of any reason to support biden for president,I think it's remerkable the amount of tax he paid. Good fo him that he took advantage the same as everyone has the opportunity to make use of.,,
2482,none,I don't believe it.,,
2489,NONE,I THINK ITS A LIE,,
2490,Help lie income,Don?t believe the way it is presented,,
2494,There isn't any reason.  He's old and senile.  He's been in office 50 years and did nothing. He's a blithering idiot and that Harris idiot will be president and destroy our way of life.,I do not care.  The media lies.  And I just don't give a crap.  Biden lives off tax payers.  Trump doesn't take a salary.,,
2501,Character and honesty leadership,Trump is a crook,,
2505,We need to remove the unstable fascist that Trump has proven himself to be.,"I have to laugh at him calling himself the ""law and order"" president. He is either a career criminal, the worst businessman who ever lived, or a combination of the two.",,
2506,None,Fake,,
2511,I can't think of any good reason to support Joe Biden. He is a career politician and in 47 years has done nothing to improve life here in the USA.  He was part of the diabolical ACA health care plan that caused many to enter into bankruptcy due to high deductibles.  With Covid-19 wasn't the ACA considered a plan that you could get healthcare if you lose your job?  Why are people going without?,"Many businesspersons have done the same thing.  There are many reasons why someone pays no federal taxes.  I really don't care one way or another, if you went digging into others you would probably find the same information.",,
2515,There is no good reason to support him.  he only picked a woman to get votes,I don't believe it.  The IRS would be right on his tail to pay the appropriate taxes that are due,,
2518,He is not Donald Trump.,"Amused and stunned , yet I knew he was hiding them for a reason",,
2520,I would not be voting for Joe Biden because he's too old to be president,It's all lies about president Trump,,
2523,there really is no reason to support him to regaurdless he is to old and the vise president will be doing all of his work and he has already shown he is going to be a radical socialist,i mean i dont believe that this is fair being that he makes trillions of doallars each years,,
2527,I have absolutely NO reason to support Biden,I do not believe this,,
2532,not trump,if true he is getting around the law again,,
2535,"He conducts himself professionally, and is a fair person. He does not just work for the wealthy - like Trump does.","I am not surprised in the slightest. At all. As a matter of fact, I am sure that there is more information in those records which would appall people. This is why he has fought so hard to hide it - he has a lot of skeletons in his closet.",,
2540,Unite the country.  Voice of reason,Reaffirms that he is a cheater...only out for himself.,,
2541,"I do not support him, but you only gave me two choices. I refuse to vote for President Trump because he is proud! I will vote for Kristi Noem because she knew the coronavirus was exaggerated and  the only governor in our country who obeyed our constitution.",Total lying nonsense. My first job was with a newspaper. I know how much reports lie for profits from advertisements and customers.,,
2547,Joe Biden is an honest and upstanding  individual. He is not bitter and hateful like the current president.,I am not surprised because there are so many loopholes for the ultra rich to not pay their fair share of taxes while regular people are struggling to make ends meet.,,
2549,Because he is an honorable man.,I am horrified that the don has paid so little in income taxes and think that he accomplished this illegally,,Caregiver
2553,He has is a compassionate and empathic person who can relate to everyone. No matter their political beliefs. He has a plan for healthcare and getting a grip on the Corona Virus. I feel he will be able to reach across the aisle and work with the Republicans.,It's absolutely disgusting! It is quite apparent he has lied about his taxes and should be charged for tax fraud.,,
2555,He has a better understanding of America; he will put people in his cabinet that are knowledgable.,He should pay his fair share.  We should look into auditing every millionaire/billonaire...pretty sure they all pay less than the average person.,,
2556,"There is no reason to support Biden for President.  He is too old and is totally clueless as to what is best for the country.  He will play the political game, like every other President has.","I work for an accounting firm and this is totally b.s.  Anyone in this country is allowed to take allowances for certain expenses, which anyone in their right mind would do.  If they wouldn't, then they are the stupid ones. And if he has enough expenses to offset his income, more power to him.  I try to do the same thing.",,
2558,"He's out for unity, healthcare, help the lower class and help control the covid 19 crisis","I find it very suspicious, I don't trust this statement. There should be a total investigation to see if He cheated. A millionair not paying his fair share of taxes",,
2559,there IS NONE,ITS FAKE NEWS,,grocery
2561,I really can't say.,Honestly I'm apathetic about politics right now.,Self employed,
2567,None,None if our business,,
2568,NO REASON,NO REACTION,,
2610,There is NONE!!!!!,I really do not care. It doesnt matter. Our democracy is at stake.,,
2615,He is not Trump,i am not surprised.  most rich people try to avoid taxes,,
2617,He is not trump and I voted fit the idiot,I can not believe the republicans put this guy up in 2016,,
2622,He is not Donald Trump who is an embarrassment for the UNITED STATES  all over the world.,"I haven't been able to pay my taxes so far this year.  I think put in a deduction of 12,00 for my  son as a consultant and 5,00 for hair cuts.",,
2624,Because anyone is better than Trump!,I'm not 100% sure I believe it fully because it may have been obtained illegally however I don't doubt that the information is true. Our economy is designed so that the rich get richer and it's disgusting,,
2626,He has a corvette,Can he help me cause h n r block sucks,,
2629,Nothing,I don?t believe it,,
2635,Best option to allow for further organizing to push the country leftward,Fuck him.,,
2636,I love joe biden and absolutely hate trump,Very very very angry,,
2638,Not Trump,He is a crook,,
2643,To remove trump before he does more harm than he has already.,Disgusting and corrupt,,
2648,No reason exists,None of my business.,Disabled,
2656,None,That is not enough information to make a judgement call. I have no reaction to this news.,,
2662,I dont,Okay I guess,,
2672,Because anyone is better than Trump,It is totally wrong and why does he get away with it,,
2682,"I have read his platform, some of it could be life changing.","It is unreal, everyday people are struggling so much to just get by,",,
2685,Trump has made too many horrible decisions and isnt fit to lead our country to prosperity.,He is a crook,,
2686,He represents our country well,if it was done legally not a problem,,
2689,Unite America,I was very upset,,
2696,The reasons that effect me the most personally are strengthening Social Security and the support of the ACA and Medicare.,Unsurprising. Trump knows all the loopholes and has connections/influence/cronies to help him avoid paying taxes. The fact that what he's done is illegal doesn't matter to him at all--he's all about grabbing as much as he can while he can and by any means possible. He doesn't care that he's been cheating and hurting the American people--he's a charlatan.,Full-time small business owner,
2701,If he can get the jobs back from all over the world. That would be my best reason.,All rich people have tax people so they pay the least amount every year.,,
2705,I can't think of a single reason.,The New York  Times is making the story up.,,
2715,Because Trump is a useless clown,He is a liar and a crook,,
2721,BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE COVID CRISIS AND GET THINGS MOVING AGAIN,ITS DISGUSTING,,
2726,The left won?t riot and loot and whine if Biden is elected,If he did that legally I have no problem. In fact I would want him in charge of the economy,,
2728,I don't see any reason to support Biden for President. He lies to our faces. He says one thing and does an about face and does exactly what he said he would not do. Biden and his family have become wealthy on the back of working people. He sent our jobs to China. Now we have to work to get them back in the U.S. Biden has not done anything for the American people for 47 years. I would not reelect him if he was the only person running for the office. Joe bailed out the car manufacturers when the economy tanked the last time and did not give anything to the working class people except loss of our AAA credit rating from the world bank the loss of our jobs. Our national debit was only claiming through the roof but for Joe it was business as usual.,What Donald Trump paid in taxes in years past really does not mean anything to me. What I am really interested in is how the country is coming back from COVID. How fast we can safely reopen businesses. I want to know what Donald Trump is going to do about the leadership of China. I already know what Biden would do. He would be in bed with China on day one!,,Help desk support.
2737,"This country needs to be united, love one another and stop the corruption, lies and hate","Does not surprise me as he is a liar, cheat and corrupt",,
2743,nothing,so he has a good tax accountant.....no evidence how much money he actually made in salary.....who cares how much he paid if he didn't claim any income if his company paid for everything.,,
2746,because he is the better person,I am outraged!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,
2747,Donald Trump is an idiot.,"I'm not positive this is accurate, as he stated it was not in the debate. In my opinion he is not trustworthy enough to confirm or deny this announcement. If this is the case, it is criminal.",,Social Work Supervisor
2753,"There is no reason to support Biden.  He is a racist and a liar.  He has had 47 years to do something in Congress and has nothing to show for it.  He stood with Robert Byrd who was a Grand Klugel in the KKK and he voted against prison reform.  He is a weak leader with no plan, he will be run by the radical left of the democratic party.  He doesn't support police.  He and his son are totally corrupt in their dealings with Ukraine and China.  He stands for nothing and basically he is senile.  He can't talk without a teleprompter.  He can't lead the world as an American president should.  All those arguments you listed on the previous page Trump has already done and more.  Trump can make deals and get things done.  Biden is just a corrupt senile politician.","A man with his vast holdings, has a very complicated tax situation.  He took huge losses in previous years which offset other years earnings.  This news is generated by bad reporting to sensationalize and misdirect uneducated people who don't understand taxes and accounting.  Trump doesn't even take a salary as president.  It is another example of the extreme media bias against Trump and is why no one buys the NYT or watches CNN anymore.",,
2754,"he will keep ss and not destroy,it",i only can say i pay a lare amount of taxes,,
2755,The best reason to support Biden is to get back to normalcy. Reestablish our relationships with our allies.,"I believe it, this is why we need to see the tax returns of all candidates running for political offices.",,
2758,He is a decent American with leadership qualities that make him the best candidate to lead our country and make decisions for all Americans.,"I am not surprised by this, but it is truly shameful. I am positive he has committed tax crimes that he should be punished for.",,
2763,There is absolutely no reason at all to support him for any office.,It is a lie. He released his returns and paid millions in taxes.,,
2764,there is none,campaign crap,,
2768,we have to get Trump out of office and get the country back to work,you can't blame him if it was done legally,,
2769,"Joe Biden isn't a buffoon, a liar, a megalomaniac. Joe Biden believes that America can be better for ALL of its citizens, not just the rich.","I think its insane that a supposed ""millionaire"" pays less in tax dollars than the average barista at Starbucks, or any public sector worker.

3578,"Because he is honest, sincere and a true leader that is experienced and ready  to bring our country back together again. Joe Biden is a person if elected that we all can be proud to call our President.",I think it's awful and shows why he doesn't want us to see his taxes because he has been cheating for years. How shameful.,,

We need a good man to replace Trump so we can stand tall and proud together.,Unbelievable.  I have paid so much in taxes for over 50 years and I have never had breaks like this.  I make just a little too much to get a benefit or not enough to get all the deduction breaks.   Not happy at all.,,

3619,he's not crazy stupid,not really surprised though he should be held accountable.,,
3621,He doesn?t lie to the people with every word he speaks.,He makes millions of dollars and it is irritating that was all he had to pay. The tax code needs to be rewritten to remove the loopholes.,,
3625,"Because Trump is an incompetant, dangerous leader.  Biden has specific goals.  Trump only has ego.",Only Trump could hide so much income.  Its a disgrace and an insult to all Americans.,,
3632,THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPORT BIDEN. HE IS NOT MENTALLY STABLE AND WOULD HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING THE COUNTRY WITH BEING THE PUPPET FOR THE DEMS.,i DON'T REALLY HAVE ONE.HE IS A BUSINESS MAN WHO EMPLOYEES MANY AND DOESN'T TAKE A SALARY.,,

3654,To end the COVID-19 crisis and end the divisions in this country,He is a cheat and a liar.  He has taken deductions that are questionable and possible illegal.  That implies that he is dishonest.  That is not a man to be leading this country.,,
3656,More personable,"It doesn't change the fact that Trump isn't a career politician  as Biden is and I believe Trump has the country's best interests at heart. He is crude and narcissistic, but he is the lesser of two evils.",,
3666,Because of his running mate Kamila Harris,I think Trump acted legally and is most qualified to be president,,
3672,I support Biden for President because I feel he has the best plan for healthcare and protecting the social security program.,This angers me as a taxpaying citizen.  Just because you can hire lawyers and accountants to find you loophole doesn't mean you have to use it.  I feel that he always touts he is America first and make America great but the way we all make America great is by paying our fair share of taxes so that there is money to invest back in our people and country.  TO me this show me that Trump isn't about making America great but about making Trump great.,,

3690,I dont im voting for trump,who cares,,
3696,can unite the country not divide it,not overly surprising as big business know all to loopholes,,
3702,I believe he will make a great leader and understands the needs of the middle class and poor.  I also think President Trump has some mental issues and should not be re elected.,Angry.  He makes much more than the average wage earner and can afford to pay much more.  He should be paying his fair share and not using tax loopholes which should not be there in the first place.,,
3717,He is a proven performer with decency and normalcy who will bring us together.,Disgusting and not surprising since he is a cheat liar and manipulator.,,
3718,There is no best reason.,"Honestly, I have lost my faith in the news industry over the years. So many of the news franchises are obviously biased one way or the other and have connections with certain political parties that I have difficulty believing they can provide objective news/stories to the public. If Trump's federal taxes were released (under questionable circumstances) I would also be interested in seeing Biden's taxes (or other major players in the Democratic party) for comparison.",,
3719,Better option than Trump,"I paid more in taxed than this man did, he gets paid more money and makes an exaggerated amount of money from companies and other jobs. People like him and the one percent need to start paying for taxes if everyone else is.",,
3721,He is not pompous and seems to truly care about the American people.,"It is unfair and makes me angry. He is rich and cheating the system and the American people, but because he has power and money, he will be able to get away with it.",,
3723,There is no reason to support Joe Biden or Camilla Harris. I don't believe in BLM it should be ALM. I am appalled how the nation is allowing the racist comments of the BLM protesters to continue. I hope cities work Camilla lives and Joe lives deep on the police and their houses get broken into. The police should stop showing up for work to show them what it's like.,If you actually look into it and read information from tax professionals typical real estate developers have numerous ways of lowering their taxes. I don't care how much any president pays in taxes I think it's a ploy to make somebody look bad.how much you paying taxes doesn't determine if you're going to be a good president or not,,

3745,Social security  and Medicare  and covid 19,I feel some one like him is america's problem,,
3747,nothing,I think that he should have paid more than that in taxes,,
3751,He is more of a people person and not as abrupt,I don't care about this whether Trump paid taxes or not.  He proabably has lost money/investments like the rest of us.,,
3752,none,it is a lie made up by democrats,,
3757,Trump is a liar,Absolutely  appaling,,
3761,the important reason... get trump out,He should go directly to prison,,retail
3767,"Joe Biden is honest, cares about all Americans, and has the experience and expertise needed to do the job.  He is respectable.",Not surprised at all.  Millionaires and billionaires are good at hiring people to find the right tax loopholes that allow them to pay far less than their share.,,
3769,"His experience,honesty, and empathy.",I am outraged that a man who uses far more in tax payer funded services than the average American pays far less in taxes than we pay in taxes just for our groceries. It is insulting to every honest American.,,

3773,"I believe Biden is much more likely to pull together and lead a team to get information, make decisions and implement procedures.","It is irritating beyond belief.  Maybe, MAYBE they were legal exemptions, but really???  I think his returns should be examined and he should be prosecuted for any illegal activity",,
3774,I can find no reason at all to support Biden for president,He's a business man and some years are better than others and he has lost money since he's president,,
3775,NONE would not be a good President,who did his taxes ????,,
3777,"No matter what his policies are, and I support some, I don't want a repulsive person like Trump as President. He wakes up every day looking for a fight and looking for somebody to pick on and bully. Trump is also way too compulsive and volatile, and lies constantly. Biden is an ethical, empathetic, caring person who will try and unite the country, who won't incite bad behavior and violence, and he's more a moderate vs a radical liberal, and that's the Democrat that I'd prefer.","It wasn't surprising, since he refuses to produce his tax records like other Presidents have done, and Trump thinks that just makes him smart. I think it's unfair for millionaires and billionaires to not pay any taxes, and the tax system should be reformed to change that.",,

3824,I think he may have a better idea on how to tackle Covid 19,"At first I was really not sure, it seemed crazy to me, and then I did hear that he had paid something much higher, but honestly do not know",,
3825,Trump is a train wreck,Unbelievable but likely as he has massive business losses and tax write offs,,
3831,I'm afraid I have no reason to support him even though neither candidate is a good one.  He's made a lot or promises but has not disclosed the how he's going to keep them.  No real plans have been disclosed.  You can say you're going to do something all you want but how are you going to execute.  His ideas are all very expensive.  How is he going to pay for them?,Can't believe everything the news puts out.  If I did Biden would be a pervert.  But he's not.  You never get the whole story.,,
3832,to remove Donald Trump who is the worst President USA has ever had,according to Trump this is fake news which is how he explains everything said about him,,
3836,That's he'll unite the country again and help not just the poor but the middle class as well ??,Well I think that's total bullshit. The man is a billionaire how in the world does he get away with paying only $750 in fucking taxes!!!,Self employed work from home ??,

He is a liar and a puppet for Putin.

Rich people should pay their fair share.,,
3851,Are you kidding me?  Are you guys high?,I don't care how much he paid in taxes.  I am sure that its a lie.  Donald Trump took advantage of tax policies that Biden created so Biden can shove it!,,
3855,Nothing  he to old,This  is bullshit,,
3856,I would never support Joe Biden.  He seems so out of touch that he could never be in control enough to keep the countrys best interests at the forefront.  He has dementia.,Trumps donates lots of money and I'm sure took business losses on which he paid no taxes.  More important he is good for America.,,
3858,Joe Biden understands those of us who are not rich but are the major portion of the people in this country.,This is news I was not surprised to hear as Trump is a crook and a cheat in everything he has ever done.  No one should expect him to pay his fair share of taxes as he thinks he is above the laws written for the little guys.,,

3937,He has Americans best interest in mind,It is so crazy to me that he was able to find ways around taxes and pay such a low amount.,,
3942,There is NO REASON to support Biden.,He did what everyone else does in  their business--use all the IRS tax exemptions available.,,
3948,I can?t suppport Biden but the best reason would be because Trump is a self centered untruthful person concerned more z out himself and his business than the average  American person.,Appalling. It?s why he has hidden this from the public to date. People struggling to make ends meet yet paying more of their income in taxes is a kick in the teeth to the average American worker,,

He truly cares about America and unlike Donald Trump he thinks it's not what his country can do for HIM, but what he can do for our country. He will listen to his cabinet members and be open to their input, even when they disagree with him He won't just fire them like he's running a TV show. He will rebuild ties with our allies and discontinue ties with our enemies. Will make an effort to reunite our country and support Black Lives Matter along with police reform.

5012,He will take the covid virus seriously and build our economy back up,He should have to go back and be audited for all of his back taxes up to 20 years ago,,
5015,The economy needs to be fixed,It really upsets me,,
5017,The only thing I would support him is with climate change. I like that he will stop fracking and work on a greener environment.,Trump has always bucked the system so this is no surprise to me seeing the amount paid in taxes.,,
5029,He is more supportive of police reform.,"I don?t mind it. He utilized putting his money in his business to avoid personal tax, as many rich people do.",,

5065,he's for the little guy,no wonder he wouldn't release his tax returns,,
5066,Kick Donald Trump out of the presidency.,Not surprising if you are aware of Trump's dealings over the past few decades. As a middle class American it always makes me angry when you have reports of rich people and corporations avoiding taxes that many of us are not privy to.,,
5074,"If I was to believe that each candidate would carry out what they say they will do, which I don't. I would have to say that Biden would attempt to lower the cost of health care better, but I don't really think that he would do that either.","If he had a legitimate reason such as he lost money, then that is the way the tax system has been set up to be. He would be in the right for doing it until the system is changed and he isn't.",,
5075,He is not as abrasive as trump,He must have had a good accountant to get tax breaks,,

5104,He will provide stability in the presidency,He?s not a very good businessman.,,
5106,I can see him supporting a bipartisan effort to govern this country. This divisive back biting has to stop and Trump can't do it.,"My husband and I made way less than $100,000 and paid way more than $750 in taxes.

5131,None,Fake news didn't tell the whole story,,
5134,I don't support Joe Biden because he has made clear that he would not maintain law and order in our cities and towns. He would also raise taxes and extend the economic shutdown indefinitely using the virus as an excuse.,I feel that his tax information should be kept out of the public eye and let the man do the job that Americans voted him in to do.,,

5146,bien is a racist,love trump,,
5150,Trump has been a shit-show. He's corrupt; he's weakened the checks and balances. His Administration has made the media an enemy. He's divided the country. He's golfed too much. He's majorly screwed up the handling of COVID. Need I continue?,Not surprised. Tax loopholes benefit those that are wealthy. What is suprising is how long the audit has and is taking,,
5153,His policies,Why do people like him get all of the loop holes while everyone else has none,,
5160,I believe he will do a better job,I am disappointed and frustrated with the news,,

Trump is a threat to America and the middle class","I was not surprised because people like him get away with this a lot, but the situation is still deplorable.

5227,None,Means nothing to me. Congress writes the tax codes.,,
5236,To beat Trump,I'm not surprised since he would not release his tax returns to the public. It's just another betrayal of the American people to the many he has committed and will commit before he is ousted.,,

Who knows how true this is.,I feel Trump might have made some mistakes by not paying taxes but remember he did not accept a salary from being the president. So maybe trump should pay more taxes in other years.,,
5297,He seems more honest,It makes him seem like he?s cheating the system,,

President Trump paid $750 in fed taxes in 2016 and 2017 and no taxes in some years, wow that is impressive for him.  And very unimpressive that this statement is a talking point let a lone a negative talking point.  Did President Trump do something wrong?  Is that the issue?  what is the issue?  The only thing stated is that he paid $750 2 years and none other years.  What do you want me to comment on here.  That is impressive.

5867,There is no good reasons to support Biden for president.  He will be controlled by the left wing or he will not be able to continue in the office and the leftist socialist will take over as president.,If someone loses money and takes advantage of provisions in the law passed by congress it is perfectly legal and ethical.  The tax returns by private individuals should be kept private.  This is attack news meant to push a legally elected president out of office.,,

6017,I don't have any reason.  He seems old and weak.  He is forgetful.  I think if he gets elected he will be declared incompetent and we will get Harris as our President and that would be terrible!,I think he took advantage of the tax laws like every other businessman or woman.

It?s truly disgusting, and it has made me and many other young people despise unfettered capitalism or capitalism in general.

6143,to beat Donald Trump,I think it is an outrage and just reinforces my opinion of him being a cheat and a liar.,,
6146,There is absolutely NO reason to support Joe Biden.  He has dementia and is too old and weak.  Before this happened he spent 47u years as a career politician and has nothing to show for it.  The Democrats inserted Kamala Harris as a  VP candidate and as president she will destroy America as we know it.  The definition of stupid is to do the same thing over again and expect a different result.  Joe Biden has done nothing in 47 years and surely won't start now in his age and mental decline.,He used tax breaks that were in place just as Pelosi's husband did.,,
6148,That he will continue social security,This is horrible he makes millions of dollars and pays less taxes than me I am struggling to survive. He should help out and pay his fair share of taxes.,,

If it turns out that everything was legal, then I won't find any fault, but I would expect Congress to CLOSELY review and update the tax laws.",,
6194,He is the best choice,Why did it take so long to find out this information?,,

In a very short time, Kamala will be the President and that would be disastrous to the US. Also serious concerns about his health, blank stares, strange statements. I'm a woman and just thinking of him creeps me out.","Most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate. He has paid millions to the federal government.

6314,There is none!,Fake news,,
6327,None unless you like socialism and no law and order and burnt down cities that he refuses to condemn.,Because he overpaid the two previous years and used real estate tax laws to cover forward the next couple of years and ended up only owing that amount that  year.  Look it up.,,

6366,He has done more for the citizens of this country than most other presidents.,"I was shocked and appalled but it goes to show why we need to close loopholes that make it possible for the rich to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and the poor who try to work are forced to take minimum wage jobs that don't pay the bills and the lazy who won't work get food stamps, free insurance, money for each child that they have and don't contribute anything to society.

He can say a lot of things but his record shows that he has not/probably will not follow through on his campaign rhetoric,a bit unsettling but he used tax laws and regulations that were legal (loopholes) to accomplish this.

6836,There is absolutely no reason to support Biden. He would be a disaster for the country.,"This is not entirely true. The $750 was the fee to file for an extension. Also, he was a business owner and had many things he could write off for losses.",,

He want to defund the police and is totally a very liberal person.,The news does not always report the truth.  The news media has been very negative about Trump since he became President.  It is because the Democratic party owns most of the TV news stations and has been against Trump from the beginning.  They are just angry they lost the 2016 election.,,retail

8108,He is an empathetic and caring person.  He is presidential and would represent the county well.,Sad.  But he is a crook and he will always be a crook so why are we surprised.,,
8115,I wouldn't. He is too old and weak to be our next president. The people that he has surrounded himself with are way too radical and unhinged to lead this counrty.,Not surprising considering he didn't have an income that year and that he sold off all of his businesses so he also didn't have any revenue from that either.,,

Why was that even brought up? The Democrats are trying everything in their power to undermine President Trump for the last 3 years+ They were also friends with him prior to him saying he was running for president. Democrats/Republicans cannot buy President Trump so they have no control and that makes everyone that's against President Trump a threat to our country.,I don't believe it. I don't pay much attention to the news anymore when they are caught time and time again lying. With that being said if he paid only $750 in taxes good for him.

8247,"I have no reason to support Biden as I believe he is mentally not capable of being President. He has been hiding in his basement for the past several months! If he were to win he won't be there for more than a year with the way he is going. Plus I think the Democratic party has gone way too far to the left and Biden has bought into it. In my opinion, Joe Biden will bring nothing that will improve the country and he will make it worse if he becomes President! I say this even though I am not a big a big fan of Trump but compared to Biden he is much better for the US.","That is most likely false information as he has a wide variety of businesses, mostly in golf and hotels, etc. As he is in the construction and hotel business he has a lot things that can qualify to be written off. I believe he has paid his share of taxes.",,

Four years from now will be a new election for anyone who doesn't like how Biden/Harris will lead the country.,"I was insulted as should all tax paying, red blooded American citizens!  How can someone who claims to be work millions pay less in taxes than I did when I was working?  We need to cut the loopholes and have everyone pay what they should be paying according to what they have and how much they make.  To say that if corporations have to pay more in taxes, they'll cut jobs.  Corporations need their employees to operate.  They could only cut so many jobs.  But they still need to be forced to pay what they owe.",,

8334,I think he is a strong person who will get our country back to where we were before the coronavirus. He cares more the middle class people than the big business people and corporations. He will not cut Social Security. He will protect our country and stop all of this violent protests.,I think he is a liar and cheater and does what he wants and thinks that he can do anything as he wants the country to run his way only. He does not seem to care about NYONE BUT BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS.,,
8338,experience,it is non of our business what he paid in taxes! that doesn't interfere with his ability to lead. We all know the crooks in Gov have made loop holes to bypass taxes. Pres. Trump just took advantage of the opportunities to do so. That shows he is engaged ijn his work completely,,

8352,there is NO reason to support Joe Biden for President.  His running mate is so concerning about BLM that she didn't even MARRY a Black man...   I wish everyone black man in america would call her out on that subject alone.  What's wrong with black men the reason SHE didn't marry one.?????   I would NEVER vote for Biden just because he picked Kamala Harris to gain the Black vote not because she is qualified and he sure isn't.  There isn't a Blk person anywhere near his neighborhood in DE yet he's seen on TV kissing every black person he can find.......  He's a disgrace and I would never vote for him even if he was Republican,If he lost $ then his $750 taxes were legal.   If  he is in so much debt then he has obviously lost $.  why should he have to pay more taxes if he did lose $?,,high school cafeteria worker

8417,There is no reason he is an old man who has had over 40 years in Washington. He has not made any changes that have really helped anyone to date.
